#Markdown:  
Is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text.  

#WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM
Markdown is a language based on the paradigm called **"What you see is what you mean"** WYSIWYM.  
Instead of "getting" what you see, WYSIWYM is built around the idea that whatever you see is what you mean.  
In practice, this means that Markdown allows you to define the structure of a text (e.g., define headings, bold text, blockquotes and links) but not what it looks like.  
Markdown files need to be processed further for publication.  
In short: Markdown files are "raw" files that require to be compiled into a final format for publishing.

WYSIWYG means that **whatever you see in your word processor will be what you see**, even when you save the document as PDF or as HTML.  
The guiding principle for WYSIWYG is that editing a document should match precisely any (exported or printed) version of it.
