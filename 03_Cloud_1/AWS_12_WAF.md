Well Architected Framework  

Introduction  
The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help design architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).  

WAF consists of six pillars, all with their own key concepts, design principles, and best practices. You should be able to name these pillars, as well as understand what they mean. You should also be able to think about architectures in the context of the Well Architected Framework.  

The mnemonic device for the six pillars is CROPSS (the first letter of each pillar). The pillars are:  
- Cost optimization
- Reliability
- Operational Excellence
- Performance efficiency
- Security
- Sustainability

AWS has them ordered as OSRPCS, but thatâ€™s a little harder to remember.
