Well Architected Framework  

Introduction  
The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help design architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).  

WAF consists of six pillars, all with their own key concepts, design principles, and best practices. You should be able to name these pillars, as well as understand what they mean. You should also be able to think about architectures in the context of the Well Architected Framework.  

The mnemonic device for the six pillars is CROPSS (the first letter of each pillar). The pillars are:  
- Cost optimization
- Reliability
- Operational Excellence
- Performance efficiency
- Security
- Sustainability

AWS has them ordered as OSRPCS, but that’s a little harder to remember.

## Key terminology
Operational excellence pillar:  
• Support development and run workloads
effectively
• Gain insight into workload operations
• Continuously improve processes and procedures to
deliver business value  

• Best practices for operational excellence:
    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures  

Security Pillar
• Protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage
of cloud technologies to improve your security
• Best practices for security:
    - Implement a strong identity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events  

Reliability Pillar
• Ensuring a workload can perform its intended function
correctly and consistently when it’s expected to
• This includes the ability to operate and test the
workload through its total lifecycle
• Best practices for reliability:
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability  
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation  

Performance Efficiency Pillar
• The ability to use computing resources efficiently to
meet system requirements, and to maintain that
efficiency as demand changes and technologies
evolve
• Best practices for performance efficiency:
    - Democratize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy  

Cost Optimization Pillar
• The ability to run systems to deliver business value
at the lowest price point
• Best practices for cost optimization:
    - Implement Cloud Financial Management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
