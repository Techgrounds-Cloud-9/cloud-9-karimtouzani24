Core Services

## Key terminology
This document should be used as a sort of guide to your AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. It highlights the services that you should know in more detail, and describes how to deal with the other services that might appear in the (practice) exam.  

There are a lot of services in AWS, but some are more important than others. AWS lists the following key services that you should have some in-depth knowledge about for the Cloud Practitioner exam:  

- Amazon EC2  
- AWS Lambda  
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon VPC
- Amazon Route 53
- Amazon S3
- Amazon S3 Glacier
- Amazon CloudFront
- Amazon RDS
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon CloudFormation
- AWS Identity and Access Management  

Of course, thereâ€™s many more services that might appear on your exam. For those, it is usually enough to just learn the product page you can find online (click here for an example of an AWS product page https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/).  

Besides the different services, you can also expect questions on cloud concepts, like the Well-Architected Framework or the cloud pricing model, as well as questions on the different support categories.
