Identity and Access Management

## Key terminology
Authentication:  
Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is.  
The identity of users is checked for providing the access to the system.  
Authentication determines whether the person is user or not.

Authorization:  
A person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources.  

Authentication is done before the authorization process, whereas the authorization process is done after the authentication process.

MFA:  
- Multi-factor authentication.
- Authentication with 2 or more factors. A factor in authentication is a way of confirming your identity when you try to sign in. For example, a password is one kind of factor, it's a thing you know. The three most common kinds of factors are: 
1) Something you know - Like a password, or a memorized PIN. 
2) Something you have - Like a smartphone, or a secure USB key. 
3) Something you are - Like a fingerprint, or facial recognition.   

Least privilege:  
The principle that a security architecture should be designed so that each entity is granted the minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function.
