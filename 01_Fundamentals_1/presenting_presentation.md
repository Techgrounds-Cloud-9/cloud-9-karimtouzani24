Why Is Structuring a Presentation Important?  
When the information is presented logically, it’s much easier for a viewer to get the message. The research supports this idea – it shows that people are 40% more likely to retain structured information than unstructured information.

What is the goal of your presentation?  
- What is the main objective of the presentation, is it to pitch investors? Get new customers? Discuss an idea with your colleagues? Never do the presentation just because “it has to be done”. Your whole pitch will be much more efficient when you know exactly why you are doing it and where you need to get your audience to.  

Who is your audience?  
- Age, profession, interests—the more you connect with your audience the more memorable will your presentation be. No matter the goal of the presentation, during your pitch, the audience is your client. And as a famous saying goes, “know your client”.  

Presentation style
There are many ways how you can style (structure) your presentation (i am going to show the standard, only mention the other types)

the steps are:  
- planning your presentation
- writing your presentation  
- designing your presentation  
- gving a memorable presentation  

“A person without a plan is lost before they start.” - Lewis K Bendele  
- this is true for many aspects of life, but especialy for making  a presentation.  

Planning Your Presentation Structure: Like Building a Lego Model (gebruik afbeelding https://visme.co/blog/presentation-structure/)  
- Is it easier to separate the correct pieces before you start building? Or is it better to search in a big bucket with mixed parts for every new piece you need?   

Before you start creating your presentation, you should always brainstorm. Think about the topic and write all your ideas down. Then think about the message you want to communicate, what your goal is and what you want your audience to remember at the end.

The first step to a successful presentation structure is to brainstorm your ideas and combine them into a rough draft. But first, consider the message you want to relay to your audience.  
- A good starting point is to decide if it will be informative, entertaining, inspiring or persuasive.  

Once you know which direction your presentation will take, it’s time to jot all your ideas down on paper to create an outline and rough draft of all the points you will cover.

1. Create an easy to follow structure:  
What is the typical presentation structure?  
- Greet the audience and introduce yourself
- the introcuction
- body
- conclusion
- Thank the audience and invite questions

introduction: 
The introduction sets the tone for the entire presentation and explains what the audience will come away with after viewing it. Here are the slides you may need to add in the intro: 
- The title. Introduce the topic of your presentation and provide a brief description.  
- A table of contents / main menu. You can make it interactive by using hyperlinks. Viewers can choose a chapter to navigate there.  
- Objectives. State your presentation’s objectives to let your audience know what new knowledge they will acquire. 

- Personal Introduction, It is best to start your presentation by briefly introducing yourself which helps to build a connection with your audience right away.
- introduce the topic, state the purpose of the presentation and provide a brief outline of the main points you will be addressing.  
- Mention the length, In the introduction, mention the approximate length of the talk and then also make sure you stick to it.
- Duration, The introduction should be no longer than two slides and provide a good overview of the topic
- briefly sum up what you are going to talk about. Introduce your general topic

- Include a quote. To make the beginning (or the end) of your presentation more exciting, 
- why is it useful or relevant to your audience.  
- Provide a statement of what you're hoping the outcome of the presentation will be, for example, "I'm hoping this will be provide you with..." 
- Starting with a strong intro can make your audience sit up in their seats and listen to you. Some ways to start your presentation include asking a thought-provoking question, listing the benefits and shocking the audience with a fact or statistic.  
- In this section also explain: 1)The length of the talk. 2)Signal whether you want audience interaction - some presenters prefer the audience to ask questions throughout whereas others allocate a specific section for this. 3)If it applies, inform the audience whether to take notes or whether you will be providing handouts. 

Body:
- facts, quotes and evidence to back up your main point.  
- The content is the real “meat” of your presentation — you need to ensure that it’s credible, full of value and crafted in a way that makes it easy for your audience to understand it. 
- you need to unravel your opening statement, give evidence by including all of your facts and statistics and include supporting arguments to prove your statements and to educate your audience on your topic.  
- The main body of your talk needs to meet the promises you made in the introduction. Depending on the nature of your presentation, clearly segment the different topics you will be discussing, and then work your way through them one at a time - it's important for everything to be organised logically for the audience to fully understand. There are many different ways to organise your main points, such as, by priority, theme, chronologically etc.

Main points should be addressed one by one with supporting evidence and examples.
Before moving on to the next point you should provide a mini-summary.
Links should be clearly stated between ideas and you must make it clear when you're moving onto the next point.  

Present your topic
The main part of a presentation should explain the topic well, state facts, justify them and give examples. Keep all the promises you made earlier in the introduction.


Length and Structure
The main part should make up about 70% of the presentation and also include a clear structure. Explain your ideas in detail and build them up logically. It should be organized chronologically, by priority or by topic. There should be a smooth transition between the individual issues. However, it is also important to use phrases that make it clear that a new topic is starting. We have listed some useful phrases for presentations here.


Images
Visualize data and statistics and show pictures to underline facts. 


Focus on the essentials
Focus on what is most important and summarize a bit. You don't have to say everything about a topic because your audience won’t remember everything either. Avoid complicated sentence structure, because if the audience does not understand something, they will not be able to read it again.


Make your presentation interactive
Make your presentation interactive to keep the attention of your audience. 

conclusion:  
- sum up with key takeaways.
- how they can put into practice what they learned.  
- make sure you loop back to your original opening statement and give your audience actionable steps to take in order to reach the solution you have to offer them.  

A good conclusion summarizes the key points you made or highlights what the audience should have learned. It clarifies the general purpose of your presentation and reinforces the reason for viewing it. Here are the slides you may want to include:

Summary. List what goals your audience have achieved, what knowledge they got, and how this information can help them in the future.
Conclusion. Here you can thank your audience for viewing the presentation.

tips:  
- No more than 10 slides in total.
Who wants to sit through pages and pages of slides? No one, that’s who. By keeping your slide deck to 10 slides, even if your presentation is 30 minutes long, you’ll give the audience a chance to digest the on-screen messages in line with your talk. Using concept maps before structuring your slides can help keep to the point. Not overwhelming your audience with too much information

2. limit amount of text on slide:
- No more than six words per slide.  
Too much text and the audience will just be reading the screen instead of looking at you and feeling the emotional impact of your message.  
- think bite-size information.  
studies show information is retained better when it’s broken down into bite-sized chunks.  
Video is a great way to do this, and research suggests it’s 95% more compelling than text. Consider adding video to your presentation strategy. But regardless, break your information up into smaller, palatable pieces.  
- One of the best ways to minimize the number of text on your slides is by using punchy phrases that aren’t full sentences.  

3. smart design:  
- use color sparingly.
bright colors can dazzle, but too many can be off-putting. Use the colors most relevant to your message. We’d recommend sticking with one or two (not counting black and white) for your palette so it has a consistent look and feel.  
- Be consistent with your font.  
Consistent design makes you look more professional. Don’t switch between caps and lower case, Times New Roman and Comic Sans, or 8 and 30 point text size. Stick with one font and one size throughout. You can vary the emphasis with your words later, but keep your on-screen text uniform for a more cohesive message.  
- Format for perfection.  
A wonky line on a slide or a badly pixelated graphic will put some people off, as it will look like you haven’t tried very hard (or worse, that you just aren’t very good). Make sure your text is aligned and neat.  

4. polish several times: Just like a pair of well-worn shoes, a good presentation often needs a few rounds of dusting before it’s shiny and sparkly.  
- Start Messy.  
Don’t be afraid to start messy. Explore and outline your initial ideas in a flexible way before you even open up PowerPoint or Keynote. Arrange your ideas side-by-side and discover new connections that you didn’t see before.  
- Edit ruthlessly.  
At first you might have a huge amount of information and will wonder how you’re ever going get it down to six words per slide. That’s OK. Keep editing ruthlessly until you’ve pared your message down to the bare essentials.  
- Get someone else to look at it.  
A fresh pair of eyes can work miracles when it comes to refining your presentation. Get a trusted mentor or colleague to review your work. If you don’t know anyone who can help, an online writing assistant like ProWritingAid or Grammarly can help you weed out a lot of problems.  

* Points 1-4 are about content and design. The next points are about the delivery. How you deliver your slides is as important as their content and design. Here are some quick pointers to help you get your message across with impact.  

5. Have a strong opening:  
- How you start and finish your presentation is extremely important. Audiences usually make up their minds about someone in the first seven seconds, so make those first moments count. 
- ?  

6. Be genuine: Oscar Wilde said “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”   
- use humor  
Telling a humorous story can break down any barriers, make you more likeable, and make your message more memorable.  
- Don’t be afraid to mess up.  
The fear of making a mistake can make you inordinately nervous. Relax, even the best speakers mess up or have bad luck.  

7. have a plan for smooth delivery:  
- Have a practice run-through.  
There’s nothing like reading it out loud to ensure your message makes sense before you actually deliver it. Try recording your presentation on video — this way you’ll be able to review with an accurate eye and notice whether your speech matches up with your slides. It’ll also help you sort out your run time.  
- Use a remote.  
A clicker or remote will help you face the audience and not have to keep turning back to your laptop  
- Use a timer.  
Put your phone on airplane mode and set the stopwatch just as you begin speaking. A quick glance down at the table during a pause will allow you to make sure you’re not going overtime.

tips:  
- Research your topic and know it inside and out.  
This way you feel confident, you’ll feel prepared for any questions and know just how to answer them.  
- Consider your audience and speak their language.  
know your crowds interest and level, because difficult technical jargon for beginners will not work.  
- Another important thing to consider when planning your presentation structure is how long your presentation is going to be.  
- One way to add context to your presentation content is to include a lot of practical examples. Telling people what a certain piece of information can mean for them in their everyday life can leave a much stronger impact than simply telling them the information exists.  
- Don’t make the mistake of cluttering your slides with text. If the information is too important to leave out, you can always add it into your presenter’s notes.  
- Incorporate your data in a visual and engaging way by using charts, graphs, maps and data widgets.  
- You can make your presentation more exciting for your audience by adding multimedia into the slides. But multimedia presentations include more than just static photos. They can also include media like embedded videos, GIFs, audio narrations, music, or interactive elements like quizzes, forms, hover effects, links, pop-ups and more.  
- Prepare thought-provoking questions.
We humans are curious creatures who love to learn and have our brains picked at. Use this to your advantage and captivate your audience’s attention by preparing some questions that require deep thinking on their part.
Here are some ideas:

Have you ever…?
What if…?
What would you do if…?
Why do you think…?  

- If you’ve ever sat through a great presentation, you'll have left feeling either inspired or informed on a given topic. This isn’t because the speaker was the most knowledgeable or motivating person in the world. Instead, it’s because they know how to structure presentations - they have crafted their message in a logical and simple way that has allowed the audience can keep up with them and take away key messages.

Research has supported this, with studies showing that audiences retain structured information 40% more accurately than unstructured information.

In fact, not only is structuring a presentation important for the benefit of the audience’s understanding, it’s also important for you as the speaker. A good structure helps you remain calm, stay on topic, and avoid any awkward silences.  

- Before choosing the presentation's structure answer these questions first:

What is your presentation's aim?
Who are the audience?
What are the main points your audience should remember afterwards?  

Research suggests that the audience remember the first and last things you say so your introduction and conclusion are vital for reinforcing your points.  

this is an description of a basic presentation structure, there are more types of specific structures, like demonstration, problem-solution and storytelling.  

Guy Kawasaki, an entrepreneur and author, suggests that slideshows should follow a 10-20-30 rule:

There should be a maximum of 10 slides - people rarely remember more than one concept afterwards so there's no point overwhelming them with unnecessary information.
The presentation should last no longer than 20 minutes as this will leave time for questions and discussion.
The font size should be a minimum of 30pt because the audience reads faster than you talk so less information on the slides means that there is less chance of the audience being distracted.
