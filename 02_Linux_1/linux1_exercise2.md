### Overcome challenges
It was no problem for me, because I have experience using linux commands, the link I used as a reminder. I couldn't find the desktop folder, I think the solution is to configure xdg files.  
But the teachter said it is not needed to solve this issue as it is not part of the assignment to succeed.

### Results

Used pwd command to find the current working directory and the ls -al command to find all the directories.
