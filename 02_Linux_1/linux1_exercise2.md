# Subject
linux files and folders  

## Key terminology
pwd:  
Shows the current directory  

cd ..  
To move to the parent directory of the current directory.  

ls -al:  
ls command to list the directory contents and the -a option is to not ignore the entries starting with a (.)  
and the -l option to use a long listing format.  

mkdir:  
Command to make a directory.  

cat > filename:  
Command to create a file.  

difference between relative and absolute paths:  
A relative path is from your current location (cd ..), and absolute is from the root (/)  


## Exercise  
1) find out the current working directory.    
2) show a list of the directories, form  where you are.  
3) create a new directory.  
4) create a file containing some text.  
5) move around your directory tree using both absolute and relative paths.

### Overcome challenges
It was no problem for me, because I have experience using linux commands, the link I used as a reminder. I couldn't find the desktop folder, I think the solution is to configure xdg files.  
But the teachter said it is not needed to solve this issue as it is not part of the assignment to succeed.

### Results  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-karimtouzani24/main/00_includes/linux1_exercise2a.png   
Used pwd command to find the current working directory and the ls -al command to find all the directories.

Used cd .. to navigate form the current directory (relative path), and used an absolute path from the root directory  
using the slash (/)
