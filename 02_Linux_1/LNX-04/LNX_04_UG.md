# Subject
Users and groups.

## Key terminology
Root user:  
Is a special type of user, the root user is allowed to do anything.  

sudo:  
This command gives you temporary root permissions, if you are allowed to do this.  

Users, passwords and groups are stored in different files in linux.  

users in the /etc/passwd file  
passwords in the /etc/shwadow file  
groups in the /etc/group file

## Exercise  
1) Create a new user in your VM.  
The new user should be part of an admin group.  
The new user should have a password.  
The new user should be able to use sudo.  

2) Locate the files that store users, passwords, and groups.  
See if you can find your newly created userâ€™s data in there

### Overcome challenges  
It was not difficult to do. Just using the right commands, to be sure I checked to links above to use the right commands.  
To add a user I used the sudo adduser command, then I entered a password.  
I added the user to the admin group and sudo group, to use sudo, with the sudo usermod -a -G group username command.  
To locate if the user is added, I used the cat /etc/passwd with grep command.  
To view if the user is added to the groups, I used the cat /etc/group with grep command.  
To view the password data of the new user, I had to use sudo cat /etc/shadow with grep command.
