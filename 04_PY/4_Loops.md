# Subject
Loops

## Key terminology
Loops:  
- can be used when you want to run a block of code multiple times.  

2 types of loops:  
- while loop  
- for loop  

while loop:  
- runs while a condition is true.
- if the condition never changes, it will be an infinite loop. Press crtl-c or cmd + c to force quit.  

for loop:  
- runs for a predetermined number of iterations.  
- the number can be hard coded using range() function or dynamically assigned, using a variable, the size of a list  
or the number of lines in a document.  
- you can also create an infinite for loop, also press ctrl-c or cmd + c to force quit. 

## Exercise  
Exercise 1:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.  

- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.
