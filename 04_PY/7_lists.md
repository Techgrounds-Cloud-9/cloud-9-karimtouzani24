## Key terminology
List:  
- Used to declare a list of values in a single variable.
- square brackets [], and each value is seperated by a comma.  
- each position in a list has a number associated with it called index.  
- index start at 0  

for loop:  

range(): returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

len(): returns the number of items in an object.

list():  

index(): Returns the index of the first element with the specified value

insert():  Adds an element at the specified position

append():  adds an element at the end of the list.

.extend(): Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list

remove(): Removes the item with the specified value

.pop(): Removes the element at the specified position

del:  

.clear():  removes all the elements from the list.

len():  

reverse(): Reverses the order of the list. 

.sort(): Sorts the list

.copy or list() to copy a list: returns a copy of the list.  

count(): returns the number of elements with the specified value. 



## Exercise
Exercise 1:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create a variable that contains a list of five names.  

- Loop over the list using a for loop. Print every individual name in the list on a new line.  

Exercise 2:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create a list of five integers.  

- Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:  
Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).
