# Subject
Conditions

## Key terminology
if:  a condition

elif:  if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition

else:  catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b  
Not Equals: a != b  
Less than: a < b  
Less than or equal to: a <= b  
Greater than: a > b  
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

## Exercise
Exercise 1:  

- Create a new script.  

- Use the input() function to ask the user of your script for their name. If the name they input is your name, print a personalized welcome message. If not, print a different personalized message.  

Exercise 2:  

- Create a new script.  

- Ask the user of your script for a number. Give them a response based on whether the number is higher than, lower than, or equal to 100.  

- Make the game repeat until the user inputs 100.
