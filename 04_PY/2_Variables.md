Variables

## Key terminology
Variable:  
It can store a value. This value can be used with the variable name. Its useful if you want to use one value multiple times.  
or if you want to dynamically change the value.  

A variable can be:  
- a string of characters (except some reserved caracters.)  

best practise:  
To use short names and clear.  

print statement:  
- to read the current value of a variable
- useful when trying to find a bug in a script.

## Exercise  

Exercise 1:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create two variables x and y. Assign a numerical value to both variables.  

- Print the values of x and y.  

- Create a third variable named z. The value of z should be the sum of x and y.  

- Print the value of z.  


Exercise 2:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create a variable name. The value of name should be your name.  

- Print the text “Hello, <your name here>!”. Use name in the print statement.  

Exercise 3:  

- Create a new script.  

- Create a variable and assign a value to it.  

- Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.  

- Change the value of that same variable.  

- Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.  

- Change the value of that same variable.  

- Print the text “Value 3: <value 3 here>”.

### Overcome challenges
To finish exercise 3, I couldn't print a string and a integer on a same line, I had to change the integer to a string with str().
