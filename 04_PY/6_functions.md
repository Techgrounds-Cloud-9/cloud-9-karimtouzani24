Functions

## Key terminology
Function:  
- block of code that only runs when it is called.  
- Functions are recognizable by the brackets () next to the function name.  
- These brackets serve as a place to input data into a function.  
- Functions can return data as a result.  

Besides the built-in functions, you can also write custom functions, or import functions from a library or package.
