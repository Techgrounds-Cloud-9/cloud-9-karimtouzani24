Functions

## Key terminology
Function:  
- block of code that only runs when it is called.  
- Functions are recognizable by the brackets () next to the function name.  
- These brackets serve as a place to input data into a function.  
- Functions can return data as a result.  

Besides the built-in functions, you can also write custom functions, or import functions from a library or package.  

Arguments
- Information can be passed into functions as arguments.  

- Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.


## Exercise  
Exercise 1:  

- Create a new script.  

- Import the random package.  

- Print 5 random integers with a value between 0 and 100.  

Exercise 2:  

- Create a new script.  

- Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.  

- Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, <string>!”.  

Exercise 3:  

- Create a new script.  

- Copy the code below into your script.  

def avg():
    # write your code here
 
x = 128
y = 255
z = avg(x,y)
print ("The average of",x,"and", y, "is", z)  

- Write the custom function avg() so that it returns the average of the given parameters.
